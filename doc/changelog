recidivm (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Capture stdin by default when stdio is not a tty.
    (This should make the -c option redundant for most practical purposes.)
  * Error out when target program fails regardless of memory limit.
  * Print the help message (-h) on stdout, not stderr.
  * Print signal names (e.g. “SIGABRT”) instead of numbers with descriptions
    (e.g. “signal 6 (Aborted)”).
  * Close unneeded file descriptors.
  * Unlink the temporary file as early as possible.
  * Improve the build system:
    + Set default PREFIX and DESTDIR.
    + Add test-installed target.
  * Improve documentation.

recidivm (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * In the first step, set virtual memory limit to 32 TiB (slightly above the
    typical usage for 64-bit ASan-ed programs).
    On x86, this should reduce the number of execs by 2 for virtually all
    target programs.
  * Round virtual memory limit to (at least) page size.
    On x86, this could reduce the number of execs by 12 (for “-u B”)
    or by 2 (for “-u K”).
  * Put license into a separate file.

  * Use LFS_LDFLAGS and LFS_LIBS in addition to LFS_CFLAGS.
  * Fix GCC 7 compiler warnings.

recidivm (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename the package.
  * Fix a typo in the manual page.
  * Fix integer overflow when rounding numbers up to the unit size.
  * Avoid trying to set limits that cannot be represented as rlim_t.
  * Document that the target program must be deterministic.
