=head1 NAME

ppvm - estimate peak virtual memory use

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ppvm> [B<-c>] [B<-p>] [B<-v>] [B<-u> B<B>|B<K>|B<M>] -- I<command> [I<argument>...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ppvm> estimates the target program's peak virtual memory use
by running it multiple times with with different memory limits.

The target program must be well-behaved:

=over 2

=item *

If the memory limit is sufficient, it must terminate with exit status 0.

=item *

If the memory limit is insufficient, it must terminate with non-zero exit status, or be terminated by a signal.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-c>

Capture stdin and provide fresh copy of it to every instance of the target program.

The default is to redirect stdin to F</dev/null>.

=item B<-p>

Don't redirect the target program's stdout or stderr.

The default is to redirect both stdout and stderr to F</dev/null>.

=item B<-u B>

Use byte as the size unit.
This is the default.

=item B<-u K>

Use kilobyte (1024 bytes) as the size unit

=item B<-u M>

Use megabyte (1048576 bytes) as the size unit.

=item B<-v>

Print information about every call to the target program.

=item B<-h>

Display help and exit.
